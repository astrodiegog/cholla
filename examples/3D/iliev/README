let C be the cholla source directory


TEST 0:
---------------------------------------
compile with TYPE=cooling
Execute these commands:

cp $C/examples/3D/iliev0/uvb_rates_I0* .
mkdir OUT
$C/bin/cholla.cooling... $C/examples/3D/iliev/iliev0.txt
$C/bin/cholla.cooling... $C/examples/3D/iliev/iliev0end.txt
python3 $C/examples/3D/iliev/load_all.py > cholla.res
python3 $C/examples/3D/iliev/plot.py

The displayed image is the result of the test. The blue line should track the lines from the background image (a figure from the original Iliev et all 2006 paper) reasonably well.


TEST 1:
---------------------------------------
compile with TYPE=rt
Execute these commands:

mkdir OUT
$C/bin/cholla.rt... $C/examples/3D/iliev/iliev1.txt
python3 $C/examples/3D/iliev/eval1.py

The evaluation script reports if the test passes. You can also visually look at comparison with the original Iliev's plot with

python3 $C/examples/3D/iliev/profile1.py


TEST 5:
---------------------------------------
compile with TYPE=rt
Execute these commands:

mkdir OUT
$C/bin/cholla.rt... $C/examples/3D/iliev/iliev5.txt
python3 $C/examples/3D/iliev/eval5.py

The evaluation script reports if the test passes. You can also visually look at comparison with the original Iliev's plot with

python3 $C/examples/3D/iliev/profile5.py


TEST 6:
---------------------------------------
compile with TYPE=rt
Execute these commands:

mkdir OUT
$C/bin/cholla.rt... $C/examples/3D/iliev/iliev6.txt
python3 $C/examples/3D/iliev/eval6.py

The evaluation script reports if the test passes. You can also visually look at comparison with the original Iliev's plot with

python3 $C/examples/3D/iliev/profile6.py
